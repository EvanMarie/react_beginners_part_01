The useRef hook is a built-in hook in React that provides a way to reference a mutable 
value that persists across renders. It returns an object with a single property, current, 
which is initialized to the argument passed to useRef().

Here's an example of how you can use useRef to reference an element in the DOM:

javascript

import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const inputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  const handleClick = () => {
    if (inputRef.current) {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus</button>
    </div>
  );
}

In this example, inputRef is a reference to an input element in the DOM. It's initialized 
to null, because the element hasn't been rendered yet. When the component is rendered, the 
ref attribute is set to inputRef, so that inputRef.current will refer to the input element 
in the DOM.

In the handleClick function, we check that inputRef.current is not null, and then call the 
focus() method on the input element. This will give focus to the input element, bringing up 
the keyboard on mobile devices and allowing the user to start typing.

useRef is often used to store values that don't affect the rendering of the component, but 
that need to persist across renders. For example, you might use useRef to store a timer ID 
for a setTimeout call, or to store a mutable object that's used in a callback function.


App.tsx:

In this code, a React functional component called App is defined. Within this component, 
two useEffect hooks are used to perform side-effects after the component is rendered.

The first useEffect hook is used to set focus on an input element when the component is 
rendered. This is done using a useRef hook to create a reference to the input element. 
The useRef hook returns an object with a current property, which is initially set to null. 
The ref object is assigned this value initially. The current property is used to reference 
the input element when the useEffect hook runs.

The useEffect hook is triggered after every render of the component. When it runs, it checks 
if the ref.current value is not null. If it is not null, it means that the input element has 
been rendered in the DOM and is available for use. In this case, the focus() method is called 
on the input element, which sets the focus on the input element, making it ready for user input.

The second useEffect hook changes the title of the page to "My App". This is done by setting 
the document.title property to the desired value. This effect is triggered after every render
of the component.

In the return statement, the input element is rendered with the ref object passed as a prop. 
This creates a reference to the input element that can be used by the first useEffect hook to 
set focus on the input element.

In React, mounting refers to the process of adding a component to the DOM. This happens when 
a component is first rendered. During the mounting phase, React will call the useEffect 
function with an empty dependency array ([]) once the component is added to the DOM. This 
is because the useEffect function is called after every render, including the first one.

On the other hand, unmounting refers to the process of removing a component from the DOM. 
This happens when a component is no longer needed and is removed from the page. During the 
unmounting phase, React will call the useEffect function with a cleanup function. This 
cleanup function is called right before the component is removed from the DOM. This is because 
the useEffect function is called after every render, including the last one.

The cleanup function is defined within the useEffect function and is returned from it. This 
function is useful for cleaning up any resources that were created during the rendering of 
the component, such as event listeners, timers, or subscriptions to external data sources. By 
performing cleanup in the useEffect function, you can ensure that any resources are properly 
released before the component is removed from the DOM.

Here's an example of how you can use useEffect to handle mounting and unmounting:

import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // This code runs when the component is mounted
    console.log('Component mounted');

    // Return a function that will be called when the component is unmounted
    return () => {
      console.log('Component unmounted');
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>Hello, world!</div>
  );
}

In this example, the useEffect function is called with an empty dependency array ([]), 
which means it will only run once when the component is first mounted. The cleanup 
function is defined to log a message when the component is unmounted.
